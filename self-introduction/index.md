Hi! My name is Evgeny. I am 33 years old. I live in Yekaterinburg. And this is my Self-introduction!

In 2008, I graduated from the Ural College of Construction, Architecture and Entrepreneurship. In the specialty Service and technical operation of road construction, lifting machines and equipment.

In 2018, I graduated from the Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University. Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. By education, I am a bachelor of vocational training, specializing in the Service and Operation of Road Transport.

In 2023 I graduated from the JavaScript/Front-end Preparatory Course at RS School.

I am currently finishing Stage 1 "JavaScript/Front-end" RS School and at the same time I work for an official Lexus dealer as a service consultant of the service department.

In my spare time, I do active sports, such as: cycling, alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, rock climbing...

My acquaintance with programming began with Stage 0 RS School. This course was recommended to me by a friend and I decided to try it. Up to this point, I have completed several free interactive JS training courses.

From the first days of studying JS, it became clear to me that this is exactly the area in which I want to develop. And I decided that I would make every effort to gain the necessary knowledge and become a software engineer.

During the passage of Stage 0 and Stage 1, I got acquainted and began to put into practice HTML, CSS/SCSS/SASS, JavaScript. Learned how to work with GitHub, Webpack and Figma. I learned how to use JavaScript to ensure the interactivity of the page.

The first weeks on Stage 0 were very difficult. In an attempt to do it right, I had to redo the tasks several times. But every time I found a solution to the problem after a long suffering, I had great pleasure and wanted to start solving new problems as soon as possible.

With each new task, I get new knowledge and consolidate what I studied before. I really like the process and I want to continue.

The last training project was Minesweeper. Cool task! I've wanted to try to write a game for a long time and there was just such an opportunity. Performing this task, I decided not to use any videos with hints, but to think of everything on my own and I did it.

I really like to think about logic, create algorithms, work with data structures. These topics are quite complex, but I feel that I will be able to deal with it in order to actively apply this knowledge in practice in the future.

In the future, I plan to dive more into the backend, learn other programming languages: Python, C++, Java. I believe that programming has great prospects and a great future. Programming is closely related to everyday life and helps to solve everyday problems. In the future, technology, science and programming languages will develop and I want to be a part of it, because it's really cool! At the moment, I see no limit to the development of programming and it makes it even more interesting.

My name is Evgeny. Thank you for watching!
